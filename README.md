## Automation Fixes Needed

- Need to work out why not allowing me to add new users
- Need to add services in somewhere - maybe in event list?
- Need to validate the schemas returned by chatgpt and feedback e.g. if not valid JSON for event schema and repeat back until schema valid
- Why does it fail if events folder is empty when doing everything by domains?
- How can I rip down the static files in the website container or do a diff to remove old ones?
